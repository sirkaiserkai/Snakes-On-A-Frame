# Snakes-On-A-Frame
Multiplayer snake game

Silly thing I made a while ago when I was first learning go. You should be able to just pull it down and get it running
```bash
go get github.com/sirkaiserkai/Snakes-On-A-Frame
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/sirkaiserkai/Snakes-On-A-Frame
go run main.go
```
And then open a browser window to http://localhost:8000

If you want to play with your friends (what's the point otherwise) you can always try out this awesome tool called ngrok:
```bash
ngrok http 8000
```
Then share and connect to the provided url to play.
